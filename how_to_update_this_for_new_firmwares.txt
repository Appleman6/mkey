Only intended for firm 11.15/11.16 for regions US,EU,JP,KR.
Otherwise, https://mkey.salthax.org/ should still work fine.
This version is only needed because the above site hasn't update its 11.16 masterkey.bin's for the 4 regions.

Steps for updating this tool for newer firmwares:

1. Skip this step unless MSET (system settings) updates. Get the Aes key for US,EU,JP,KR is at mset virtual addr. 0x0026b35c (code.bin+0x0016b35c). Paste the 16 bytes to a file named: ctr_aes_0?.bin, where ? is region code: 1=US, 2=EU, 5=KR, 9=JP.

2. While in Godmode9, masterkey.bin is found by navigating to SYSNAND CTRNAND/title/000400db/00017X02/content/000000??.app, then Press A -> Ncch image options -> Mount image to drive -> romfs/masterkey.bin -> Press A -> Copy to 0:/gm9/out. Then find the file in SDMC:/gm9/out/masterkey.bin. This needs to be done for all 4 regions as well. The X in the titleID low (/00017X02/ above) of CVER varies by region. It's not important. You may also use 3Dnus and ctrtool to extract the masterkey.bin. Consult those apps for instructions.

3. Rename masterkey.bin to ctr_XX_YY.bin where XX is the first byte (in hex) in the same file, and YY is the second byte in the file (also hex). Put these 4 renamed files in the data folder and the new firmware should now be supported.


Note: TWN and CHN have horribly outdated msets, so there is no masterkey.bin because they use an older mkey algorithm. https://mkey.salthax.org/ should still support them even when firmware updates.
